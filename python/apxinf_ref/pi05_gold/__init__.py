"""Deterministic Pi0.5 PyTorch eager references.

Two modules, split by what they need rather than by size.
:mod:`pi05_gold.artifact` is the fixture, the stored encoding and the gate an
artifact has to pass; it imports no torch at module scope, so it loads -- and is
tested -- on a host with no device stack.  :mod:`pi05_gold.capture` drives a
model and does need torch, so it may only be imported after ``bootstrap_torch``.
``generate_pi05_torch_gold.py`` beside this package is the CLI.

``SOURCE_ROOT`` is the directory holding this package and the ``_vendor``
snapshot it loads; putting it on ``sys.path`` is what lets both modules import
that snapshot.  The entry point installs the same directory before it can import
us at all, so the guard only stops it happening twice.
